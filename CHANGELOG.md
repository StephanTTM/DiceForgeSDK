# Changelog

All notable changes to DiceForge SDK will be documented here. This project intends to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `@diceforge/core`: headless engine (`createDiceEngine`) resolving dice rolls and coin flips offline with no renderer, UI, or network dependencies.
- Dice notation grammar v1 (`parseDiceNotation`): `[count]d(sides|%)` for d4–d100, `kh`/`kl`/`dh`/`dl` keep/drop, `+`/`-` chaining with integer modifiers, positioned `DiceNotationError` diagnostics, and documented input limits (ADR-0006).
- Seeded, cross-platform reproducible RNG (`createSeededRandomSource`, xoshiro128\*\* + cyrb128) locked by golden known-answer tests, plus a non-reproducible system source (`createSystemRandomSource`); provenance embedded in every result (ADR-0005).
- Immutable, schema-versioned event records (`RollResult`, `CoinFlipResult`, `schemaVersion: 1`) with per-die kept flags in rolled order and deterministic keep/drop tie-breaking.
- Validating canonical JSON serialization (`serializeEvent`, `deserializeEvent`, `validateEventRecord`) that recomputes totals, drops unknown fields, and rejects unsupported schema versions.
- npm-workspaces monorepo with strict TypeScript, Biome, Vitest (62 tests), GitHub Actions CI on Node 20/24 (ADR-0004), and a runnable headless example (`npm run example`).
- Initial project charter, architecture guidance, roadmap, task list, decision records, contribution guidance, and Claude Code prompt.

## Release policy

- Categorize entries as Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, or Security.
